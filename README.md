# Nozzle-----Con-Di

This Project is a visualization of Mach Number, Velocity and Pressure inside a Convergent - Divergent Nozzle. The details of this project is represented in the report.

## Boundary Conditions

inlet pressure = 101325 pascals.
initial gauge pressure = 100000
outlet gauge pressure = 2814 from isentropic table
Gamma = 1.4
